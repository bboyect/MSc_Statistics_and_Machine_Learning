The code is very well structure, with a lot of commentaries. It is very readable. You did the bulk of your generate_text.py in the main function, which is not super clean. In addition, note that when generating text, you could keep in memory the successors frequencies of the words already encountered, that would save time when producing long text. But it is still an excellent submission. That is a pass, good job !
