Hi. Here are some comments about your submission:



5g. What this question asks it to calculate the norm of the difference between Ax and b, i.e., np.norm(A.T @ np.linalg.lstsq(...) - b), to show that what you get is an actual solution to the system of equations.



5l. You should be calculating the rank of houses.data, not just houses, which is indeed 8.



6f. Your subspaces implementation is incomplete. As the question states, if the rank of data is less than k you should only use that many rows. This is the case for large values of k.



6g. You forgot to remove your original implementation of the classification.



6h. - Note that when indexing a range in Python the first value is inclusive but the last is exclusive, so the range [0:600] includes 0 but not 600. Therefore your range for the validation data should start at 600 and not 601.



Good work. You have passed this assignment.
