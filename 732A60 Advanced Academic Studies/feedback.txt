Interesting paper, thank you.

"Using grounded theory, in other words, not making a hypothesis before data collection, is a
good way not to be restricted by the framework laid down before the interview." - is that correct? One usually use theory to decide on hypothesis that are being tested. One should not adjust research questions to the data.

Can one conclude generally about Taiwanese students based on interview with one person?

Looking forward to discuss your paper on the workshop.
